<p>on bottom left, i changed the sync branch to the testbranch and created a new file. i could not make the new file
    name the same as the one created on github.
</p>

<p>i could push my file into the branch but don't understand how to clone or pull a branch from githbu.</p>
<p>oh, the file is here...?</p>
