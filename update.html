test edit from github repo edit button


-------
after this edit, on your vscode, in the bottom left corner, it shows the arrow circle that there was a change made in the repository.
then you may sync it to pull the changes into your local repo.

-------
now, what will happen when i have made changes on github repo and also the the local repo?


seeing how it will do when i have made changes on local machine but there are changes also on github repo.
so okay. it shows pending changes on here.
and 1 pull commit.
when i check the source control sidebar, it allows me to see the incoming commit from github repo and compare the lines.
i will now click on fetch option.
