test edit from github repo edit button


-------
after this edit, on your vscode, in the bottom left corner, it shows the arrow circle that there was a change made in the repository.
then you may sync it to pull the changes into your local repo.

-------
now, what will happen when i have made changes on github repo and also the the local repo?

seeing how it will do when i have made changes on local machine but there are changes also on github repo.
so okay. it shows pending changes on here.
and 1 pull commit.
when i check the source control sidebar, it allows me to see the incoming commit from github repo and compare the lines.
i will now click on fetch option.
don't know what happened. combined two - the commit and pending changes by copy paste. it offers now to push and pull both files.
will click and see.

so it then says there is a conflict and shows a button "resolve in merge editor."
it has a window of your file, github file and a combined one you can edit.
in incoming changes, i checked "accept incoming" and "accept combination". idk, but no worries, nothing gets deleted. 
then complete merge. commit. sync changes.
